# rdd
README driven development for me. README.md here is the example. 

## background
I like the idea of [README driven development (RDD)](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html). I won't develop a library. Rather, I develop scripts. So I developed a tiny subset for README.md for RDD.

Because I use a standard template from GitHub, description is automatically on the second line.

The license will be on the separate LICENCE file and should not be included in the README.md.

CONTRIBUTE.md shall accompany when it shall, so CONTRIBUTE.md things should not be included in the README.md.

## install
This repository is not even a script. But for the actual case, something like the following should be here.
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:hfu/rdd.git
$ cd rdd
```

## usage
This repository is not even a script. But for the actual case, something like the following should be here.
```console
$ node index.js 1 2 3
```
